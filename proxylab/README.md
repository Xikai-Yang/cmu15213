### ProxyLab

This lab requires us to implement a proxy which is an intermediate between the client and server on the Internet

And there are three tasks

Task 1: implement a sequential web proxy which will deal with the request one by one

Task 2: implement a concurrent web proxy which can deal with multiple concurrent requests

Task 3: Caching web objects so that our proxy can perform better
