This assignment will help you develop a detailed understanding of how malloc was implemented under the hood

In this lab, I've tried several data structures to organize the memory under the hood

it includes: implicit list / explicit list / segregated lists

And I've adopted LIFO policy to insert and delete the free block from the lists

Besides, I've also rewritten the "realloc" function to improve its performance
